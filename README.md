![message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72122101/140685724-1c155e30-c473-4700-9804-ac17572c0efc.png)

This is the repo which I rebuild [this repository](https://github.com/nakanoi/wanttotravel4you). I coded it with React + AWS Amplify, but I wanted to build backend API with Ruby on Rails.
So, I build this with React + Rails API + Nginx + MySQL on Docker compose.

## Tech

I used these techniques below.

### Backend
- [`Ruby on Rails`](https://github.com/rails/rails) - with API mode.
- [`Nginx`](https://nginx.org/) - as a reverse proxy.
- [`MySQL`](https://www.mysql.com) - Database.
- [`Rspec`](https://rspec.info/) - as a API test module.
- [`Devise token auth`](https://devise-token-auth.gitbook.io/devise-token-auth) - as a authentication module.
- [`Websocket(Actoin Calbe)`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) - to build realtime chat fumction.

### Frontend
- [`React`](https://github.com/rails/rails) - with frontend.
- [`Nginx`](https://nginx.org/) - as a reverse proxy.
- [`material UI`](https://mui.com/) - as a UI design. This page's disign is terrible? I'm sorry... I'm not good at this.

### Container
- [`Docker, Docker compose`](https://www.docker.com/) - run 5 containers, which area for each service above.
